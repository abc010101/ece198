CLIQUE Processes:
	1. getNextHop
		- solve for nextHop using CLIQUE
	2. tableUpdate
		- update table info
	3. infoUpdate
		- update info

Q-Table
	- contains
		neighbors[]
			nID
			cID
			qVal
			battStat
			sinkID

Routing Table:
	- in the Routing layer
	- concerned with inter-cluster routing


this.node refers to the node in subject

Next hop neighbor
	- Every neighbor that can send a packet to this.node
	- Populated in neighbors[]

DATA packets:
	- packets containing observed data
	- contains feedback info

DATA_REQ packets:
	- packets broadcasted by the sinks
	- propagated in the network

Clustering:
	- assigned
	- grid-based

Intra-cluster routing:
	- Handled by CLIQUE

Inter-cluster routing:
	- Handled by routing layer
	- Only applies to aggregated DATA packets and DATA packets sent by CH 

Feedback info
	- only in DATA packets
	- includes nID, cID, sinkID, qVal, battStat

Frequency of Data Gathering and Data Transmission
	- can be set
	- set to 2s by default
	- duration set to 1s by default

Node ID (nID):
	- starting with 1
	- 0 is used as destNode at startup when there are no neighbors yet

START

GET INTERNAL FLAGS AND PARTIAL QTABLE FROM ROM

IF SINK ===> AGGREGATE MODE, STORE RECEIVED DATA TO ROM, DISABLE CLIQUE MODULE
	SINK START
	Broadcast DATA_REQ Packets
		DATA_REQ Packets handled by routing layer
			updated with cumulative routing info every time it passes through a node
			stored in ROUTING TABLE
			discarded if already passed through node

		ROUTING TABLE updated with node to sink[] cost
			cost is defined as the sum of radio power of each hop


START RX, RAMP RX POWER (ASSUMING NO POWER/RX/TX CONTROL UNIT) UNTIL NEIGHBOR==MIN_NEIGHBORS
	Initial (Neighbor <= MIN_NEIGHBOR)
	Process all

GATHER DATA AND TX EVERY (FREQ=/5sec)
	INITIAL
	destNode = 0
