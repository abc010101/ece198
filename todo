ONE PAGE SUMMARY
SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Definitions, Conventions
Proof of Concept
EACH BLOCK, brief discussion
Integration and Synthesis

HALFWAY DOCUMENTATION:
//Update Title
//FOCUS NA SA CLUSTERING AND Q-LEARNING
//Update Problem Statement and Objectives, focus on the context of Microlab/Rese2nse

RRL
+  

//INCLUDE OMNET++ Basic parts to work: NED, ini, CC, Data Analysis

METHODOLOGY
A. Conventions
	//Conventions: FP data, Memory width, Network size, neighbor limit
	//Definitions?
B. Preliminary Work
	*** Dapat ba sa methodology yung pagexplore sa CLIQUEv1 code? 
	Preliminary Simulation (OMNET++)
		Functionality, Operation Basics
		CLIQUE v1 Codebase?
			FF3
			Dependencies
		CLIQUE v2? Modifications to Forster operation
C. Proof of Concept
	Proof of Concept
		CLIQUE Network (Software) operation validation
		Hardware functionality verification/simplification ()
		Fixed point convention checking/validation??
D. ML HW Design
	Hardware
		//Discuss each block and module used in the block, Functionality then modelling (1 section per block)
		//Discuss optimizations done: one add/mult for all states, etc.
D1. Memory
		Memory
			Discuss memory format and allocation, controller
D2. Fixed Point operations
		
D3. Cost evaluation
		Cost evaluation
			Make flowchart, block diagram , state diagram(?)
			Discuss operations
D4. Q-Table Update
		QTable Update
			Make flowchart, block diagram, state diagram (?)
D5. Winner Policy

D6. Reward

		//Integration
		//Synthesis

**UPDATE ML HW ENERGY MEASUREMENTS
**UPDATE WSN SIMULATION
**EVALUATION AND COMPARISON?

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
	Proof of Concept




Todo:
1. Rename blocks
	Cost evaluation -->
	Qtable update -->
	Winner Policy -->
	Reward -->
	Memory -->
2. Update chapter 5
3. Block diagrams for each block
4. Scope ng memory? ROUTING TABLE or QTABLE?
	External access ---> Routing(Inter cluster)
5. Settle sa naming: CLIQUE v2? ML? ...
6. Read through 190 paper, pinpoint needed changes
7. Handle limit on memory ??? OVERFLOW
8. Make updated block diagram accdg to flowchart
	add storage of last feedback info
	throw unnecessary feedback info, optimize
	revise test.py
